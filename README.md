# student-performance-factor-analysis

## 📂 Dataset Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## 🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to perform clustering on a student dataset and assign each student to a well-defined cluster. By applying clustering techniques, we aim to segment students based on relevant characteristics, providing a deeper understanding of patterns, behaviors, or distinct groupings among the students.

## 🥅 Goals

1. **🔍 Cluster Prediction**: 
   - Using clustering algorithms, identify the underlying groups within the dataset and predict the cluster each student belongs to.
   
2. **🏷️ Cluster Labeling**:
   - Label each student based on their assigned cluster, providing insights into the distinct features or traits associated with each group.

## 💡 Purpose
This analysis aims to identify potential factors influencing student behavior or performance. The insights gained can assist educational institutions in tailoring their approaches to better meet the diverse needs of students.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- **🧹 Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and clean the dataset for clustering.
- **🔗 Clustering Analysis**: Apply clustering algorithms to segment students.
- **🏷️ Cluster Labeling**: Assign meaningful labels to each cluster based on observed characteristics.
- **📊 Result Interpretation**: Analyze and interpret the clusters to understand the factors influencing student performance and behavior.

## 🌟 Potential Applications
This clustering analysis can aid educational institutions in:
- 📌 Identifying groups of students with similar needs or behaviors.
- 🎯 Developing targeted interventions to support different student clusters.
- 📈 Enhancing resource allocation based on student groupings.
